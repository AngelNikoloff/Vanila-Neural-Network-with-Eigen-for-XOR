# Vanila_ANN_with_Eigen_for_XOR
Simple vanila neural network for XOR solving made with Eigen Library - for education purpose;

Because my goal was education - I made it as simple as posible;

The point of the project is to show how to use matrices and vectors manipulations for creating neural networks;
 ( instead of useing "FOR" circles )

It is Visual Studio 2015 C++ project;

Used Eigen Library v. 3.3.7 for linear algebra: matrices, vectors; 
 ( Eigen is included in the zip file );
