# Simple vanila neural network for XOR solving made with Eigen Library - for education purpose;

Because the purpose of this project is education - I made it as simple as posible;

The goal of the project is to show how to use matrices and vectors manipulations for creating neural networks;
 ( instead of using "FOR" circles )

It is Visual Studio 2015 C++ project;

Used Eigen Library v. 3.3.7 for linear algebra: matrices, vectors;
